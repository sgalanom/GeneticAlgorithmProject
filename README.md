# Optimization Techniques - Function Approximation Using Genetic Algorithm and Gaussian Basis Functions in MATLAB

Seventh-semester project focusing on approximating an unknown continuous function using input-output data points. To achieve this, we designed and implemented a genetic algorithm in MATLAB utilizing a combination of 15 Gaussian basis functions.
